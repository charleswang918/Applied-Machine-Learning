For random forest part, the 551p4.ipynb contains the random forest model and the dataset processing.
For CNN part(rest of the ipynb files), simply run it on the colab as I changed some code from the original user. The folder also contains a orginal README from the github page.
For more information of the code, the github page is https://github.com/AFAgarap/cnn-svm.
